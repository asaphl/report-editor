# report-editor

A block editor for generating automated reports. The idea for this project originated in a much larger project which required a display editor for data in a separate database without the ability to change the data, but rather organize display for better understanding.

The editor is built with React-Redux. Drag and Drop components are based on react-beatiful-dnd. Styling is with Material-UI. Backend is an express server and a PostgreSQL db. Entire repository is deployed to heroku, and is available at: https://report-editor.herokuapp.com/
